modules:
	window: sdl initialization, glcontext setup
	vao: Vertex Array Object, glVertexAttribPointer (vap), glVertexBufferObject (vbo)
	vertex format parser handles <type> <dim> [name] [',' or ';'] '\0'
	up to 16 which is gl standard,
	type is 'f', 'i', 's' or 'c'. with optionally 'u' or 'n' at any point
	these stand for the first letter in float, int, short, char, unsigned, normalize
	normalize tells gl to map integers to [1,-1], according to their type


installing MXE:
git clone mxe and `make glew sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer sdl2_net sdl2_ttf ogg mpg123`
then `export PATH=/path/to/mxe/usr/bin:$PATH`





quirks:
sdl defines 'main' and we cant use it inside QUOTE() for shaders, main is made undefined in libs.h

input & main thread:
DE_GAME_LOOP calls SDL_PumpEvents which can only be called from the main thread
without pumping events the engine cant see them
SDL_PollEvents calls pump too
keyboard events with repeat will be ignored on keyboard state
mouse relative state gets reset each call to dinput_update

opengl:
the attribute parser is weak so dont use names that appear on the header or anywhere before the actual variable name
ie dont use attribute def; since it will be found on "#define ..." segment;
either this or enforce " name;" to minimize the problem //todo

glsl:
only consts can be used in a global initializer, glsl v100 error, some androids
every float number in glsl must have an explicit decimal
if you dont use a variable in glsl it gets optimized away, if this is an attribute or uniform, it will change the index and cause graphic bugs, note that it is not enough to assign a variable to an unused variable.

gl ibo ext:
GL_UNSIGNED_INT and GL_OES_element_index_uint extension:
even tho this should work on gles2 the only device i have to try it gives GL_INVALID_ENUM
as if the extension wasn't aviable despite it being in glGetString(GL_EXTENSIONS)
so element buffer object is made with shorts for the moment ...


makefile:
it doesnt detect included headers so it will not update every file and it's buggy
the simplest way to fix it is `make rm && make`
the android makefile handles this correctly


audio:
when using sdl mixer don't call the following sdl functions:
SDL_OpenAudio, SDL_CloseAudio, SDL_PauseAudio, SDL_LockAudio, SDL_UnlockAudio.
use Mix_Pause(-1) and Mix_PauseMusic or Mix_Resume(-1) and Mix_ResumeMusic instead.
it is also a BAD idea to call SDL_mixed and SDL audio functions from a callback.
Callbacks include Effects functions and other SDL_mixer audio hooks


android:
SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE required for apps with both portrait and landscape orientations


TODO
handle sdl event android background, text composition, dropfile, mouse wheel

fix wine mousegrab slowdown
